### **Optimized Dependencies**
Only essential packages for maximum efficiency:
- `record` - Audio recording
- `just_audio` - Audio playback
- `path_provider` - File management
- `permission_handler` - Microphone access
- `audio_session` - Cross-platform audio management

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Audio Analysis Pipeline**
1. **Record** → 20-second WAV capture with metronome count-in
2. **Analyze** → Real-time pitch detection using autocorrelation
3. **Detect** → Musical key identification with advanced algorithms
4. **Suggest** → Intelligent chord progressions based on melody
5. **Visualize** → Clean piano interface with chord highlighting
6. **Play** → Realistic piano synthesis for chord preview

### **Minimalist Interface**
- **Single record button** - Clean, functional design
- **BPM slider** - Efficient tempo control (no arrows or dials)  
- **Compact piano** - Essential chord visualization
- **Progressive disclosure** - Advanced settings when needed
- **No visual clutter** - Focus on essential functionality

## 🔧 Development

### **Code Quality Standards**
- Senior Flutter development practices
- Comprehensive cleanup (removed 3,942 lines of unused code)
- Optimized build size and performance
- Clean architecture with separation of concerns

### **Testing & Building**
```bash
# Run analysis
flutter analyze

# Build for Android
flutter build apk

# Run tests
flutter test
```

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**True Minimalism Through Restraint**
- Remove all unnecessary visual elements
- Beauty through function, not decoration  
- Generous white space and clean lines
- Typography-focused visual hierarchy
- Maximum 3 colors in entire interface

**Apple/Dieter Rams Principles:**
- Less but better
- As little design as possible
- Good design is unobtrusive
- Form follows function
